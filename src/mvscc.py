"""Multi-version concurrency-control audit core.

The auditor receives a frozen audit history:

* an ``initial`` key/value snapshot,
* a set of at most 24 transactions, each with a start timestamp
  (``start``), a commit timestamp (``commit``) and an ordered list of
  read/write steps,
* every read step declares what it observed: either the literal
  ``initial`` value or the id of the transaction whose write it read.

Two questions are answered:

1. **Version validity** -- did every read observe the newest version of
   the key that was committed *before the reading transaction started*
   (snapshot / first-committer-wins semantics)?  A read that violates
   this is reported as an ``INVALID_READ`` input error.
2. **View serialisability** -- is the history equivalent to some serial
   execution?  We build the multi-version serialisation graph with the
   three classic anti-dependencies:

   * write -> read / read-dependency edges (``ww``),
   * write -> write version-order edges (``ww``),
   * read -> later-write anti-dependency edges (``rw``).

   An acyclic graph yields one canonical serial order (topological order
   broken by transaction id).  A cycle is reported as the shortest cycle,
   ties broken by the lexicographically smallest id sequence.

# are forbidden.  The solver below is an exact branch-and-bound for graphs of
# at most ``MAX_TRANSACTIONS`` (24) vertices:
#
#   * bit-mask state with memoisation;
#   * forced deletions for self loops;
#   * repeated removal of vertices with zero in- or out-degree in the induced
#     graph (they cannot lie on any directed cycle);
#   * SCC decomposition -- cycles never span SCCs, so each cyclic SCC is an
#     independent subproblem and independent optima combine (also for the
#     lexicographic tie-break);
#   * branching over the vertices of a shortest directed cycle: every feedback
#     set must contain one of them.
